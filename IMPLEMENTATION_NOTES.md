# Implementation Notes

This document provides technical details about the implementation of the Options Analysis module and how it relates to the theoretical concepts in the resource documents.

## Key Concepts Implemented

### 1. Volatility Surface Visualization

The implementation creates a 3D visualization of implied volatility that matches the reference image from the resources:

- Uses moneyness (strike price relative to spot price) instead of absolute strikes
- Maps days to expiry on one axis, moneyness on another, and implied volatility on the vertical axis
- Highlights term structure (volatility across time) and skew curves (volatility across strikes)
- Uses a vibrant color scheme with a dark background for better visualization

### 2. Put/Call Ratio Analysis

Based on the "Put_Call_Ratio_and_Volume.txt" document:

- Calculates PCR by both volume and open interest
- Interprets values using thresholds (>1.2 for bearish, <0.7 for bullish)
- Visualizes PCR by expiration date to track sentiment changes across time
- Combines PCR with volume data for context

### 3. Support and Resistance from Option Levels

Based on "call_put_levels.txt":

- Identifies high open interest levels in puts below current price as potential support
- Identifies high open interest levels in calls above current price as potential resistance
- Visualizes these levels and their distance from current price
- Includes volume information for additional context

### 4. Gamma and Delta Exposure

Based on "gamma_delta_exposure.txt":

- Calculates approximate delta and gamma values for each option
- Aggregates by strike price to create exposure profiles
- Visualizes positive and negative gamma exposure separately
- Highlights the net exposure line across strike prices
- Shows the net delta exposure profile for market directional bias

### 5. Gamma Flip Detection

Based on "gamma_flip.txt":

- Identifies points where net gamma exposure changes sign
- Determines if flips are from positive to negative or vice versa
- Calculates the distance from current price to the nearest flip point
- Provides interpretation of the market impact of the flip

### 6. Multi-Expiration GEX Analysis

Based on the reference image "Gnovdm-WwAAoTlm.jpeg":

- Creates a 4-panel visualization showing gamma exposure for key expirations
- Highlights positive and negative gamma with appropriate colors
- Includes relevant price levels (support, resistance, highest volume)
- Shows the GEX profile curve for each expiration

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Storage Organization

The module creates a structured directory system:

```
- data/
  - {TICKER}/
    - {TICKER}_calls.csv
    - {TICKER}_puts.csv
    - {TICKER}_calls_with_greeks.csv
    - {TICKER}_puts_with_greeks.csv
- results/
  - {TICKER}/
    - {TICKER}_pcr_analysis_{DATE}.csv
    - {TICKER}_greeks_exposure_{DATE}.csv
    - {TICKER}_gamma_flip_{DATE}.csv
    - {TICKER}_support_resistance_{DATE}.csv

    - {TICKER}_support_resistance_{DATE}.png
    - {TICKER}_multi_expiry_gex_{DATE}.png
```

### Greek Calculations

The implementation uses standard approximations for option Greeks:

- Delta approximation: Uses the relationship between moneyness and delta
- Gamma approximation: Based on normal distribution density function
- Delta exposure: Delta × Open Interest
- Gamma exposure: Gamma × Open Interest

### Visualization Techniques

Several advanced visualization techniques are employed:

1. **3D Surface Plots**:
   - Uses Plotly for interactive 3D surfaces
   - Includes contour lines and term structure/skew curves
   - Uses interpolation for smoothing gaps in the data

2. **GEX Profiles**:
   - Separates positive and negative gamma for clear visualization
   - Highlights key price levels and flip points
   - Includes annotations for important features

3. **Multi-Panel Plots**:
   - Synchronized axes and color schemes across panels
   - Consistent formatting with reference legend
   - Dark background design for better contrast

## Extension Possibilities

The implementation could be extended in several ways:

1. **Time-Series Analysis**:
   - Track gamma flip points over time
   - Correlate PCR changes with price movements
   - Analyze changing volatility surfaces across days

2. **Additional Greeks**:
   - Implement vanna, charm, and vomma calculations
   - Visualize theta decay across the surface
   - Create "Greek surfaces" similar to volatility surfaces

3. **Market Maker Impact Simulation**:
   - Model price impact of delta hedging at different gamma levels
   - Simulate intraday volatility based on gamma exposure
   - Predict potential amplification of price moves

4. **Alert System**:
   - Create alerts for significant gamma flip points near current price
   - Monitor unusual changes in PCR or open interest
   - Identify volatility surface anomalies
